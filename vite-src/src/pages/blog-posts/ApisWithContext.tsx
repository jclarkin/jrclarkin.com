        This week was spent gaining context on APIs. Questions such as: Who are the consumers 
        of the APIs, What is the minimum viable check we want in place for a single API, and 
        How do we ensure that our API testing is comprehensive and effective?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Understanding the context of APIs is crucial for effective testing. We need to know 
        who will be using the APIs, what their expectations are, and what scenarios they might 
        encounter in real-world usage.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We're also exploring different approaches to API testing, from simple functional tests 
        to more complex integration tests that simulate real-world usage patterns.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The goal is to create a testing strategy that ensures our APIs are reliable, performant, 
        and meet the needs of our users.
