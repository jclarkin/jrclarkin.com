When looking at a potential coach or teacher, I find myself often using the following criteria to help me make a selection.

Openness: Do they expose their ideas and opinions in public forums? Do they allow discourse and feedback on their material, or is it a one-way channel?

Prior Art: Research material authored by the coach: articles, blog posts, videos, code, tweets, publications. Are ideas clearly expressed and compatible to your mode of learning?

Bias: Do they present multiple facets to ideas? Is there personal incentive for endorsing one idea over another?

Interpersonal: The "Play nice with others" factor. How do they behave in a group? Do they foster relationships and enable growth? Do they advocate for peers in their profession?

Referral: Use your network of both people you know or online personas you respect and see if any of them approve or refer to the trainer or their material.

Experience: Review the individual's listed skills, credentials, and experience. Can you trust them to bring authentic information that you believe applies to your needs?

This is not a comprehensive list (all models are flawed). What questions do you ask yourself when evaluating potential mentors, coaches, trainers, or teachers?

What I ended up doing was creating a simple framework to avoid the common pitfalls of choosing trainers based on fame, price, or gut feeling alone. These six criteria help me focus on what actually matters - whether someone can effectively teach me what I need to learn in a way that works for me.

The best trainer for you may not be the most famous or expensive one. It's the person whose strengths align with your needs, whose approach resonates with your learning style, and whose expertise can genuinely accelerate your growth.
