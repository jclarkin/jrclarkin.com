A colleague asked me to investigate JavaScript unit testing options for developers. While planning my approach, a realization struck: **I'm testing something - a domain of knowledge.** 

If I'm testing, why not use proven testing techniques to structure the investigation?

## Test Sessions for Knowledge Exploration

Enter the experiment: applying test session methodology to research. I've:
- Defined a **mission**: Evaluate JavaScript unit testing tools for developer adoption
- Written an **initial charter**: Explore available testing libraries, frameworks, and tooling
- Started **documenting my path** through online resources, documentation, and community contacts

## Why This Approach Works

Test sessions bring structured thinking to research:
- **Time-boxed exploration** prevents endless rabbit holes
- **Charter-driven focus** keeps investigation targeted
- **Session notes** capture both discoveries and dead ends
- **Explicit reporting** creates actionable deliverables

Instead of wandering through JavaScript testing frameworks aimlessly, I'm treating the problem space like any testable system - with hypotheses, exploration strategies, and documented outcomes.

## The Meta-Learning

This experiment in applied methodology has a bonus: I'm simultaneously learning JavaScript testing tools AND improving my research process. The session notes will become the foundation for my first formal test report outside traditional software testing.

**The insight**: If knowledge domains can be explored like software systems, then testing techniques can improve how we learn and share discoveries. Time to see where this chartered exploration leads!
