My responsibilities include researching and investigating tools to help others test software. I was recently asked to investigate options for helping developers author unit tests for JavaScript applications.

While thinking about performing the investigation, it came to me that I was testing something: a domain of knowledge. And what is a good tool to record such testing? Test sessions!

So I'm experimenting with this idea. I gave thought to my mission, wrote up an initial charter of exploration ideas, and have begun recording my path through the internet and contacts to learn more on JavaScript unit testing. Once I wrap it up, I will likely have more charters to explore and can try my hand at my first test report to hand back to the person requesting this information.

What I ended up doing was treating knowledge exploration like any other testable system. Instead of wandering through JavaScript testing frameworks aimlessly, I'm applying the same structured thinking I use for software testing - with hypotheses, exploration strategies, and documented outcomes.

The insight is that if knowledge domains can be explored like software systems, then testing techniques can improve how we learn and share discoveries. Time to see where this chartered exploration leads!
