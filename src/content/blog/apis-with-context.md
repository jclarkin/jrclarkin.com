This week I dove deep into understanding APIs through their context. The key questions driving my exploration: Who are the API consumers? What's the minimum viable check for each endpoint? How do we ensure comprehensive coverage without over-testing?

**Context changes everything in API testing.** An internal microservice API has different reliability requirements than a public-facing REST API used by thousands of developers. The testing strategy must match the stakes.

## The Critical Questions

- **Who consumes this API?** Internal teams, external partners, or public developers each have different tolerance for downtime and breaking changes.
- **What are the core success scenarios?** Not every endpoint deserves the same level of testing rigor.
- **How do users actually interact with this API?** Testing isolated endpoints misses the real integration patterns.

We're exploring a spectrum from lightweight functional tests that verify basic request/response patterns to comprehensive integration tests that simulate realistic usage flows.

The goal isn't perfect test coverage - it's **strategic coverage** that ensures our APIs are reliable, performant, and serve their intended purpose without wasting effort on unlikely edge cases.
