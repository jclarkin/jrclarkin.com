It is time to start learning about virtual machines. Microsoft is kindly offering up free VMs to do browser testing. I find this exciting because it opens up new possibilities for testing across different environments and configurations.

Virtual machines provide a way to test applications in isolated environments that can be easily created, destroyed, and recreated. This is particularly valuable for browser testing, where you need to test across different operating systems, browser versions, and configurations.

Microsoft's free VM offerings include various Windows versions with different browsers pre-installed. This makes it much easier to test web applications across a wide range of environments without having to maintain physical machines for each configuration.

I'm looking forward to exploring how we can integrate these VMs into our testing processes and what new testing scenarios they might enable.
