Most software features fall into familiar categories: external (customer-facing) and internal (operational). Developers often add a third: deprecated (marked for removal). But enterprise software has taught me there's a fourth category that deserves recognition: **vestigial features**.

## The Four Categories Defined

**External Features** solve customer problems and create value for software buyers. They justify the product's existence.

**Internal Features** solve company problems, reducing maintenance costs and improving development efficiency.

**Deprecated Features** are former solutions - internal or external - that no longer provide significant value. They're technical debt with a clear removal plan.

**Vestigial Features** are mysteries. They likely solved someone's problem once, or were intended to. Their current value is unknown, and they can't be confidently flagged for removal. They represent technical debt with no mitigation strategy.

## The Biological Parallel

Like the human appendix, vestigial features persist in our software ecosystem long after their original purpose becomes unclear. Medical science once considered tonsils vestigial until research revealed their immune system role. Similarly, software features might serve purposes we've forgotten or never documented.

## The Enterprise Reality

Enterprise software accumulates vestigial features through acquisitions, staff turnover, incomplete documentation, and evolving requirements. Each represents a small maintenance burden and testing complexity that compounds over time.

**The testing opportunity:** We can design investigations to uncover vestigial features' original intent, current usage, and business value. Sometimes we'll discover hidden gems; other times we'll find safe candidates for removal.
