A coworker shared a ThoughtWorks SlideShare presentation that introduced me to Brian Marick's Agile Testing Quadrants model - a framework I'd never encountered before but found compelling.

## The Communication Challenge

Our team is developing a problematic attitude: "We can test everything via automation. Programmers can test it all with more code." This perspective, while understandable, misses the nuanced reality of effective testing.

The Agile Testing Quadrants provide a visual framework for communicating why different types of testing serve different purposes:

## Why This Matters

Each quadrant represents testing with different goals:
- **Technology-facing tests that support development** (unit tests, component tests)
- **Business-facing tests that support development** (functional tests, story tests)  
- **Technology-facing tests that critique the product** (performance, security tests)
- **Business-facing tests that critique the product** (exploratory, usability tests)

This model helps explain why automation excels in some quadrants while human judgment remains irreplaceable in others.

## Next Steps

I've added *Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams* to my reading list:

Exposing teams to models like this should help accelerate understanding of human testing's value. Change takes time, but clear frameworks make the conversation more productive.
