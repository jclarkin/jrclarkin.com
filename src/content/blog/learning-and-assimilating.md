I may be new to the testing team at work, but I am no stranger to the culture exposed on the internet. I have long been a reader of many online blogs regarding testing. To name a few of my regular reads:

- Keith Klain's Quality Remarks
- James Bach's Satisfice
- Andy Glover's Cartoon Tester
- Scott Barber's Peak Performance (infrequent updates)
- Jonathan Kohl's blog
- Michael Bolton's Develop Sense
- Anne-Marie Charett's Maverick Tester
- Cem Kaner's Blog

On top of that, if you watch twitter, it is a hotbed of conversations and battles on the definition of "Testing" and the visionary future of the field.

I wish I knew where the similar meta-level conversations happen around other aspects of software craftmanship. Most conversations I have spotted are to highlight the latest cool tool or technology. The focus on the long-term sustainability and improvements might not be happening in the recorded public spaces.

Speaking of culture, I am a partial stranger to the culture of testers at my work. Luckily I often talk to members of the team, but that is different from being fully submerged in the plights and passions of the individuals. Now I shall strive for a deeper empathy.

I am listening to conversations and asking questions. I hope to be able to contribute meaningfully to my new family.

I need to give thought to my direction, as there are many roads that can be traveled.
