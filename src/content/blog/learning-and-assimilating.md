I had been reading testing blogs for years before joining the testing team at work. I was a regular reader of Keith Klain's [Quality Remarks](http://qualityremarks.com/), James Bach's [Satisfice](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/), Andy Glover's [Cartoon Tester](http://cartoontester.blogspot.ca/), Scott Barber's [Peak Performance](http://scott-barber.blogspot.ca/) (infrequent updates), Jonathan Kohl's [blog](http://www.kohl.ca/blog/), Michael Bolton's [Develop Sense](http://www.developsense.com/blog/), Anne-Marie Charett's [Maverick Tester](http://mavericktester.com/), and Cem Kaner's [Blog](http://kaner.com/). I followed the Twitter conversations about the definition of "Testing" and the visionary future of the field.

But when I actually joined the testing team, I realized I was still a stranger to the culture. I had been consuming content from the internet, but that's completely different from being fully submerged in the day-to-day plights and passions of the individuals on the team.

I wish I knew where similar meta-level conversations happen around other aspects of software craftsmanship. Most conversations I've spotted in other fields focus on highlighting the latest cool tool or technology. The focus on long-term sustainability and improvements might not be happening in the recorded public spaces.

Now I'm listening to conversations and asking questions. I hope to be able to contribute meaningfully to my new family. I need to give thought to my direction, as there are many roads that can be traveled.

What I learned is that being an internet consumer of testing content is quite different from being fully immersed in the day-to-day challenges and conversations of working testers. The transition taught me that joining a professional community requires more than just reading about it - you have to be present, ask questions, and contribute to the ongoing conversations.

I tried to capture my learnings in a [guide for myself and others](/guides/building-testing-career-guide) who want to build their testing career and join the professional community.
