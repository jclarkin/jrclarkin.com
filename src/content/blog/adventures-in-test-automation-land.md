Starting this month, I shall be adopting a new role as a test automation tools developer. What this means is that I will be exploring and analyzing areas for automation, and then building tools to help others automate their testing.

I am excited about this opportunity. I have been interested in testing for a while now, and have been reading blogs and articles about testing practices. I am looking forward to learning more about the tools and techniques used in test automation.

I will be working with a team of experienced testers and developers, and I am looking forward to learning from them. I will also be attending conferences and workshops to learn more about the latest trends in test automation.

I will be blogging about my experiences and learnings as I go along. I hope to share insights and tips that might be helpful to others who are also interested in test automation.

Stay tuned for more updates!
