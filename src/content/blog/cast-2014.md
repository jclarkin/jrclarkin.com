Day one at my new job came with an unexpected challenge: "Submit a proposal to CAST for a conference talk. You have 42 hours."

CAST - the Conference for the Association of Software Testing - immediately struck me as different from typical industry conferences. No corporate sponsors pushing products, no hidden sales agendas, no shark-tank atmosphere. Instead, it felt more like an academic conference: sessions designed for genuine discussion and mutual learning between attendees and presenters.

## The 42-Hour Sprint

I dove in, selecting a topic that genuinely excited me and outlining enough substance for a 40-minute presentation. After crafting my proposal, I sent it into the digital void, hoping for the best.

The proposal reached Bernie Berger and Paul Holland, the conference co-chairs. Then came the surprise: **I've been selected to present this August in New York City!**

## First-Time Everything

This represents several firsts for me:
- First trip to New York
- First professional conference attendance
- First presentation to peers outside my employer  
- First international travel planning to the US
- First encounter with TSA scanners (the anxiety is real!)

## The Weight of Opportunity

Being selected feels like both an honor and a significant responsibility. I have months ahead to craft an engaging, educational presentation worthy of my peers' time and attention.

The testing community has welcomed me with this opportunity. Now comes the real work: delivering value that justifies their confidence.

Wish me luck! ðŸ—½
