I have experienced the departure of many colleagues at Mxi, and each time it has been emotional and stressful. Now it is my turn to leave. I wanted to minimize that same gut-punch to my friends and team. So, like Tom Sawyer, I was able to attend my own funeral. The weirdest part was that I played the role of meeting coordinator, in discussing the aftermath of my departure.

## The Agenda

As with any retrospective or post-mortem, it is important to have a skeleton of the meeting, to set expectations for attendees. Here was our plan:

- What does Jonathan do on the team?
- Which skills or roles will the team need to support?
- If the team is to hire a new member, what depicts this ideal candidate?
- What other stressors are caused by Jonathan's departure, and how can we decrease them?

## Judgement Day

After some levity about the awkwardness of this meeting, the first activity began. Each team member wrote down the things they believe I had been doing on the team. I was to not participate in this ideation, forcing everyone else to reflect on my visible and invisible roles.

The team came up with a pretty comprehensive list of my roles and responsibilities. Some things I expected to see, some I didn't. It was great to see that I had been doing a good job of making my contributions visible to the team.

## Skills and Roles

Next, we discussed which of these skills and roles the team would need to continue supporting after my departure. This helped prioritize what was most critical to address.

The team identified several key areas where my departure would create gaps:

- Test automation strategy and implementation
- Mentoring junior team members
- Cross-team collaboration and communication
- Process improvement initiatives

## The Ideal Replacement

We then brainstormed what the ideal replacement candidate would look like. This wasn't just about technical skills, but also about personality traits and working style that would fit well with the team.

## Addressing Stressors

Finally, we discussed the broader stressors that my departure might cause and how to mitigate them. This included both immediate tactical concerns and longer-term strategic considerations.

## The Satir Change Model

Throughout this process, I kept thinking about the Satir Change Model and how teams go through predictable stages when dealing with change. Understanding this helped frame our discussions in a more constructive way.

## Final Discussions

The meeting concluded with some great discussions about how to ensure a smooth transition and maintain team morale during the change.

## Reflections

This "peri-mortem" approach was incredibly valuable. It allowed us to:

1. **Surface hidden assumptions** about my role on the team
2. **Plan proactively** for the transition instead of reactively
3. **Reduce anxiety** by addressing concerns openly
4. **Create a roadmap** for hiring and knowledge transfer

I'd highly recommend this approach to anyone planning a departure from a team. It's much better to have these conversations while you're still there to participate in the solutions.

The experience also reinforced for me how important it is to make your contributions visible and to actively develop others on your team. The best legacy you can leave is a team that's stronger and more capable because of your time with them.
