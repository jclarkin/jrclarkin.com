My first week in, and I am being exposed to my team mates' interests. My cube mate has done some great things to make front-end automation tools available to all developers. He has created a framework that allows developers to easily write automated tests for their front-end code.

I am learning about the different approaches to testing. There are manual tests, where a human tester goes through the application step by step, and there are automated tests, where a computer program runs through the application automatically.

Manual testing is great for exploratory testing and finding unexpected bugs, but it can be time-consuming and repetitive. Automated testing is great for regression testing and ensuring that existing functionality still works after changes, but it requires upfront investment in writing the tests.

I am looking forward to learning more about both approaches and finding the right balance for different situations.
